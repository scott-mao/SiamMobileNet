# High-speed-target-tracking-based-on-Light-Weight-Siamese-Network-
With the widespread use of target tracking in many life scenarios, the demand for high-precision and high-speed tracking algorithms is also increasing. For some specific scenarios such as mobile terminals, embedded devices, etc., under the premise of relatively insufficient computing power of the device, it is still necessary to ensure that the tracker achieves good tracking accuracy and high-speed real-time tracking. a high frame rate tracking algorithm based on light-weight Siamese network was proposed to solve this problem. First, select the light-weight convolutional neural network MobileNetV1, which is easy to be deployed in embedded devices, as the feature extraction backbone network The deep network is more capable of extracting target features; then, two optimization strategies are proposed to address the short-comings of the backbone network, feature map was cropped and adjustment of the total network step length make the backbone network suitable for tracking tasks; Finally, After the template branch of the Siamese network, an ultra-lightweight channel attention moudle is added to weight important information that highlights the target characteristics. Compared with the current mainstream algorithm SiamFC, the algorithm parameters in this paper are reduced by 59.8%; simulation experiments on the OTB2015 dataset show that the tracking accuracy (Prec.) has increased by 5.4%, and the algorithm can better cope with the complex and changeable challenges in tracking tasks; The simulation experiment on the VOT2018 dataset shows that the comprehensive index(EAO) has increased by 26.6%, and the average speed of the algo-rithm under NIVIDA GTX1080Ti is 120FPS, achieving high-speed real-time tracking.
